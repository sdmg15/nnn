`nnn` needs a curses library with wide character support (like ncursesw), libreadline and standard libc. It's possible to drop libreadline using the Makefile target `norl`.

#### Utility dependencies

The following table is a complete list. Some of the utilities may be installed by default (e.g. desktop opener, file, coreutils, findutils) and some may not be required by all users (e.g. sshfs, vlock, advcpmv).

| Dependency | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| xdg-open (Linux), open(1) (macOS), cygstart (Cygwin) | desktop opener |
| file, coreutils (cp, mv, rm), findutils (xargs) | detect type, copy, move and remove files |
| trash-cli | trash files (default: delete) |
| mediainfo / exiftool | multimedia file details |
| atool / patool ([integration](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/hacking-nnn#integrate-patool)) | create, list and extract archives |
| vidir (from moreutils) | batch rename dir entries |
| sshfs, fusermount(3) | mount, unmount remote over SSHFS |
| vlock (Linux), bashlock (macOS), lock(1) (BSD) | terminal locker |
| advcpmv (Linux) ([integration](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/hacking-nnn#show-cp-mv-progress)) | copy, move progress |
| `$VISUAL` (else `$EDITOR`), `$PAGER` (less, most), `$SHELL` | fallback vi, less, sh |

Note: Help & settings, file details, media info and archive listing are shown in the PAGER. Use the PAGER-specific keys in these screens.

#### Leader key

The Leader key provides a powerful multi-functional navigation mechanism. It is case-sensitive and understands contexts, bookmarks and location shortcuts.

| Key | Function |
|:---:| --- |
| <kbd>1-4</kbd> | Go to/create selected context |
| <kbd>></kbd>, <kbd>.</kbd> | Go to next active context |
| <kbd><</kbd>, <kbd>,</kbd> | Go to previous active context |
| key | Go to bookmarked location |
| <kbd>~</kbd> <kbd>`</kbd> <kbd>@</kbd> <kbd>-</kbd> | Go to HOME, `/`, start, last visited dir |
| <kbd>q</kbd> | Quit context |

#### Contexts

Contexts serve the purpose of exploring multiple directories simultaneously. 4 contexts are available. The status of the contexts are shown in the top left corner:

- the current context is in reverse
- other active contexts are underlined
- rest are inactive

To switch to a context press the Leader key followed by the context number (1-4).

The first time a context is entered, it copies the state of the last visited context. Each context remembers its last visited directory.

When a context is quit, the next active context is selected. If the last active context is quit, the program quits.

##### Context-specific color

Each context can have its own directory color specified:

    export NNN_CONTEXT_COLORS='1234'
colors: 0-black, 1-red, 2-green, 3-yellow, 4-blue (default), 5-magenta, 6-cyan, 7-white

#### Selection

Use <kbd>^K</kbd> to select the file under the cursor.

To select multiple files:

- press <kbd>^Y</kbd> to enter selection mode. In this mode it's possible to
  - cherry-pick individual files one by one by pressing <kbd>^K</kbd> on each entry (works across directories and contexts); or,
  - navigate to another file in the same directory to select a range of files
- press <kbd>^Y</kbd> again to save the selection and exit selection mode.

_NOTE:_ If you are on BSD/macOS, please check the [BSD terminal issue](https://github.com/jarun/nnn#bsd-terminal-issue) with <kbd>^Y</kbd> for workaround.

Selected files are visually indicated by a `+` before the entries.

The selection can now be listed, copied, moved, removed, archived or linked.

Absolute paths of the selected files are copied to the temporary file `~/.config/nnn/.selection`. The path is shown in the help and configuration screen. If `$NNN_COPIER` is set the file paths are also copied to the system clipboard.

#### Filters

Filters support regexes (default) to instantly (search-as-you-type) list the matching entries in the current directory.

Common use cases:
- to list all matches starting with the filter expression, start the expression with a `^` (caret) symbol
- type `\.mkv` to list all MKV files
- use `.*` to match any character (_sort of_ fuzzy search)

There is a program option to filter entries by substring match instead of regex.

#### Navigate-as-you-type

In this mode directories are opened in filter mode, allowing continuous navigation. Works best with the **arrow keys**.

When there's a unique match and it's a directory, `nnn` auto selects the directory and enters it in this mode. To disable this behaviour,

    export NNN_NO_AUTOSELECT=1

This mode takes navigation to the next level when short, unique keypress sequences are possible. For example, to reach `nnn` development directory (located at `~/GitHub/nnn`) from my `$HOME` (which is the default directory the terminal starts in), I use the sequence <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>n</kbd>.

The **_wild load_** option can be extremely handy for users who use this mode constantly. The entries are unsorted when the directory loads. Applying filters sorts the entries (with directories on top). Directory color is disabled in this mode.

#### File indicators

The following indicators are used in the detail view:

| Indicator | File Type |
|:---:| --- |
| `/` | Directory |
| `*` | Executable |
| <code>&#124;</code> | Fifo |
| `=` | Socket |
| `@` | Symbolic Link |
| `@/` | Symbolic Link to directory |
| `b` | Block Device |
| `c` | Character Device |
| `?` | Unknown |

#### Configuration

`nnn` supports the following environment variables for configuration.

| Example `export` | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NNN_BMS='d:~/Documents;D:~/Docs archive/'` | specify bookmarks (max 10) |
| `NNN_OPENER=mimeopen` | custom file opener |
| `NNN_CONTEXT_COLORS='1234'` | specify per context color [default: '4444' (all blue)] |
| `NNN_IDLE_TIMEOUT=300` | idle seconds before locking terminal [default: disabled] |
| `NNN_COPIER='/absolute/path/to/copier'` | system clipboard copier script [default: none] |
| `NNN_NOTE=/home/user/Dropbox/notes` | path to note file [default: none] |
| `NNN_TMPFILE=/tmp/nnn` | file to write current open dir path to for cd on quit |
| `NNN_USE_EDITOR=1` | open text files in `$EDITOR` (`$VISUAL`, if defined; fallback vi) |
| `NNN_NO_AUTOSELECT=1` | do not auto-select matching dir in _nav-as-you-type_ mode |
| `NNN_RESTRICT_NAV_OPEN=1` | open files on <kbd> ↵</kbd>, not <kbd>→</kbd> or <kbd>l</kbd> |
| `NNN_RESTRICT_0B=1` | disable 0-byte file open; see [#187](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/issues/187), use _edit_ or _open with_ |
| `NNN_TRASH=1` | trash files to the desktop Trash [default: delete] |
| `NNN_OPS_PROG=1` | show copy, move progress on Linux |

#### Hot-plugged drives

External storage devices can be (un)mounted using the plugin [nmount](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/blob/master/plugins/nmount).

For auto-mounting external storage drives use udev rules or udisks wrappers.

#### SSHFS mounts

To connect to and mount remote shares using SSHFS, `nnn` requires the ssh configuration file `~/.ssh/config` to have the host entries. sshfs reads this file.

Example host entry for a Termux environment on Android device:

```
Host phone
    HostName 192.168.0.102
    User u0_a117
    Port 8022
```

The above host `phone` will be mounted at `~/.config/nnn/phone`. `nnn` creates the directory `phone` if it doesn't exist.

Notes:

1. `nnn` takes you to the mount point after successful mounts. To jump back to the last directory, press the usual <kbd>-</kbd>.
2. `nnn` doesn't delete the mount point on unmount to prevent accidental data loss. **Please ensure the mount point is not mounted if you are deleting it manually.**
3. More information on [SSHFS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSHFS).

#### Help

    $ nnn -h
    $ man nnn
To lookup keyboard shortcuts at runtime, press <kbd>?</kbd>.

#### PLUGINS

To extend the capabilities of `nnn`, [plugins](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/tree/master/plugins) are introduced. Plugins are scripts which `nnn` can communicate with and trigger. This mechanism fits perfectly with the fundamental design to keep the core file manager lean and fast, by delegating repetitive (but not necessarily file manager-specific) tasks to the plugins.

Use the pick plugin shortcut to visit the plugin directory and execute a plugin. Repeating the same shortcut cancels the operation and puts you back in the original directory.

If you have an interesting plugin feel free to raise a PR.

#### TROUBLESHOOTING

##### Tmux configuration

`nnn` might not handle keypresses correctly when used with tmux (see issue #104 for more details). Set `TERM=xterm-256color` to address it.

##### BSD terminal issue

TLDR: Use the keybind <kbd>K</kbd> to toggle selection if you are having issues with <kbd>^Y</kbd>.

By default in OpenBSD & FreeBSD (and probably on macOS as well), `stty` maps <kbd>^Y</kbd> to `DSUSP`. This means that typing <kbd>^Y</kbd> will suspend `nnn` as if you typed <kbd>^Z</kbd> (you can bring `nnn` back to the foreground by issuing `fg`) instead of entering multi-selection mode. You can check this with `stty -a`. If it includes the text `dsusp = ^Y`, issuing `stty dsusp undef` will disable this `DSUSP` and let `nnn` receive the <kbd>^Y</kbd> instead.

##### 100% CPU usage

There is a known issue where if you close the terminal directly with `nnn` **_waiting for a spawned process_**, a deadlock occurs and `nnn` uses 100% CPU. Please see issue [#225](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/issues/225) for more details. Make sure you quit the spawned process before closing the terminal. It's not a problem if there is no spawned process (`nnn` isn't blocked) as `nnn` checks if the parent process has exited.

#### WHY FORK?

`nnn` was initially forked from [noice](http://git.2f30.org/noice/) but is significantly [different](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/nnn-vs.-noice) today. I chose to fork because:
- one can argue my approach deviates from the goal of the original project -  keep the utility `suckless`. `noice` was rudimentary. In my opinion evolution is the taste of time.
- I would like to have a bit of control on what features are added in the name of desktop integration. A feature-bloat is the last thing in my mind. Check out the [design considerations](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/design-considerations) for more details.

Trivia: The name `nnn` stands for _Noice is Not Noice, a noicer fork..._.
